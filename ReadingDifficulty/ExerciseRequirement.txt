Write a program that evaluates the difficulty of reading a sentence in English.

Things that make words hard to read are:
- Occurrences of "ch", "ei", "ie" (ex. "ei" in "Receive")
- More than two vowels in a row (ex. "uai" in "Acquaintance")
- Double consonants (ex. "mm" and "tt" in "Committee")
In addition, sentences are hard to read if such words are close to each other.

Calculate a score for a sentence using the following rules:
- 1 point for each string that makes a word hard to read
- 2 points for each pair of words that have difficult to read strings
- 1 point for two words that have difficult to read strings and are separated by one other word

Try to use functions where appropriate. Ex. isVowelSequence, isDoubleConsonant, countDifficultStrings

Examples:

My acquaintance addresses the committee
Score from each word: 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 5
Score from sentence: 2 (acquaintance addresses) + 1 (addresses the committee)
Final score: 5 + 3 = 8

We perceive the quay's occasional accessibility as an issue
Note: "quay's" is considered a word
Score: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 (from words) + 1+1 + 2 + 2 (from sentence) = 12
